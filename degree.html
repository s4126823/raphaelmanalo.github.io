                    <ul>
                        <li><b>User-Centred Design (AD) - ISY3356 </b><br>This course introduces an approach to
                            developing user
                            interfaces for interactive systems such as software or web applications, with regard to the
                            requirements of the client and the experience of the users. You will learn to analyse user
                            needs and
                            design, implement and evaluate various solutions to meet those needs. You will learn to use
                            web-based tools for information gathering and analysis, appropriate design software, and to
                            implement prototypes for evaluation using basic programming where appropriate. This course
                            serves as
                            an introduction to later courses in web and application development.</li>

                        <li><b>Web Programming A - COSC2446 </b><br>This course introduces you to the basic concepts of
                            the World Wide Web
                            (the web), and the principles and tools that are used to develop Web applications. The
                            course
                            provides an overview of client/server technology, and introduces you to the important web
                            protocols,
                            HTML for content and structure, CSS for presentation, client-side processing with ECMAScript
                            (JavaScript) and server side processing with PHP. It teaches you how to implement a dynamic
                            web site
                            using files and databases for data persistence. SQL is used for database interactions. Some
                            basic
                            principles of site design, graphic design and usability are also touched on.</li>

                        <li><b>Networking 1 - COSC2385 </b><br>This course introduces you to computer networking,
                            particularly Local Area
                            Networking. You will learn fundamental computer networking terms, concepts and components,
                            IP
                            address and subnetting. You will develop skills in basic network configuration (wired and
                            wireless),
                            routing protocols (static and dynamic), switched networks, security, and troubleshooting.
                            This
                            course includes a Work Integrated Learning experience in which your knowledge and skills
                            will be
                            applied and assessed in a simulated workplace context and where feedback from industry
                            and/or
                            community is integral to your experience.</li>

                        <li><b>Cyber Security Foundations - INTE2643 </b><br>Cyber security is a practice of protecting
                            the integrity of
                            network systems, applications, data, and digital assets from cyber-attacks that tend to
                            access,
                            alter, or destroy important information from an organisation or individual. In this modern
                            era of
                            technological advancement, cybersecurity is more important than ever. Implementing an
                            effective
                            cybersecurity practice becomes more challenging due to more devices that are needed to
                            protect from
                            the sophisticated attacks that a cyber-criminal can perform.</li>

                        <li><b>Foundations of Artificial Intelligence for STEM - COSC2960 </b><br>This course introduces
                            the foundations of
                            Artificial Intelligence (AI) tailored to students from a range of health, science,
                            technology,
                            engineering, and math disciplines. AI is a branch of computer science devoted to developing
                            intelligent hardware and software systems. Applications of AI are now widespread in the
                            world of
                            work. It is therefore increasingly important for all health, science, technology,
                            engineering, and
                            math disciplines graduates to have an understanding of the foundations and applications of
                            the field
                            of AI relevant to their own discipline. This course will also challenge you to consider the
                            impact
                            and ethics of AI on your future profession and society.</li>

                        <li><b>Introduction to Programming A - COSC2511 </b><br>In this introductory course, you will
                            acquire foundational
                            knowledge about the conceptual building blocks necessary for programming and computer
                            programming
                            skills with basic object orientated constructs combined with procedural programming in Java.
                            Primitive object orientated programming mixing data and functions (which Java calls methods)
                            are
                            taught. The emphasis is on teaching programming techniques which are transferrable to other
                            programming languages. The course has two goals: teaching the art of programming and the
                            academic
                            study of coding through a written exam to improve comprehension of technical knowledge and
                            prepare
                            the student for further higher education and job application. By the end of the course, you
                            are
                            expected to have acquired a range of programming skills in the Java programming language.

                        <li><b>Programming A - COSC2395</b><br>This course introduces you to the fundamental principles
                            and practices of
                            computer programming using object-oriented design. The Java programming language is
                            introduced and
                            used in the practical work. The course assumes no previous knowledge of programming.</li>

                        <li><b>Networking 2 - COSC2384</b><br>This course extends your understanding of computer
                            networking. It deepens
                            your knowledge of Routing Protocols and introduces you to switched networks. You will
                            develop skills
                            in the Command Line Interface configuration of switches, port security, VLANs, VTP and
                            inter-VLAN
                            routing as well switch security,routing and MLS. It deepens your knowledge of wireless
                            networks and
                            also Wide Area Networks with emphasis on directly connected serial links, PPP authentication
                            and
                            redundancies technologies. You will develop skills in the configuration of advanced IP
                            addressing
                            techniques and the implementation of Access Control Lists. This course includes a Work
                            Integrated
                            Learning experience in which your knowledge and skills will be applied and assessed in a
                            simulated
